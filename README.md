# Pump-it-up

This is a competition entry for the Pump It Up competition for Driven Data. See link below for further information.

My intial entry after about 4 hours was ranked just outside the 25th percentile. I used Random Forest and selected features solely based on intuition. I am now going back through and completing further EDA to determine wat additional features would be useful to improve the 0.77 accuracy score of the first submission, approx. 0.83 was the top score at last check. The latitude and longitude were the best predictors as of yet and I am considering using unspervised clustering to determine if the creation of a feature tied to population centers could be helpful. Also looking into funders and installers to see if binning all but the top 5 or so can help improve the predictive power of that feature.
